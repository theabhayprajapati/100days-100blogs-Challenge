## Next.js + MongoDB + Tailwind + TypeScript template

[`Next.js + MongoDB + Tailwind + TypeScript template 📄`](https://github.com/theabhayprajapati/Next.js-TailwindCSS-MongoDB-TS "Next.js")


## 🤔💭 Reason for making this template

Actually, I dont's like to do **configuration** of my project, again and again, which leads me to go out and find a template and what I got one, which was officaly from MongoDB.

[`template`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mongodb) from [`MongoDB`](https://mongodb.com)

### Why I am not using that?

The template which was configured for [`Next.js`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) + MongoDB;
but not for [`TypeScript`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and [`Tailwind`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).

And then what I got and 💡 for making one for myself, at that moment i don't know to make a templates; 
**but it is very easy to make one thanks [`Github`](https://github.com)**.


### 📝 How to use it ?.

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/theabhayprajapati/Next.js-TailwindCSS-MongoDB-TS with-mongo-tail-app
```

**Folder Strcture 🗿**

***Pay attention to lib folder [`Lib`](https://github.com/theabhayprajapati/Next.js-TailwindCSS-MongoDB-TS/blob/main/lib/mongodb.ts)***

it includes [`mongodb.ts`](https://github.com/theabhayprajapati/Next.js-TailwindCSS-MongoDB-TS/blob/main/lib/mongodb.ts)


### 👷🏾‍♂️ What does the MongoDB.ts does ?
The Main function of this file is to get your mongodb url and make a function which can use anywhere where you need mongodb access.

**But in most cases you don't need to touch it; it has been 🧑🏾‍💻 configured for you.**

## Things you need to 😜 perform to make use of it.

**go to [`env.local.example`](https://github.com/theabhayprajapati/Next.js-TailwindCSS-MongoDB-TS/blob/main/.env.local.example) add your MongoDB_URI; which you can easily get from MongoDB.**


1. After adding your MongoDB_URI, you need to run `npm run dev` to make sure that it works.
2. **You will see this screen** ![MongoDB](/day7/mongodbscreen.png)


3. Change the name of file [`env.local.example`]([https://](https://github.com/theabhayprajapati/Next.js-TailwindCSS-MongoDB-TS/blob/main/.env.local.example)) to **env.local**


## Congo 🎊, It works.

now you can easily work with mongoDB, in Next.js
